Hi there üëã I'm Dan Hawkesford (he/him).

I'm a student software developer from London, and in August 2022 I graduated with Cohort 12.0 at [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/), a free, 16-week, full-time bootcamp teaching full stack software development! 

Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-hawkesford/).

üî≠ I recently built a photography ranking website, aimed at encouraging people to keep active ([Site](https://the-wall-app.netlify.app/) | [Repo](https://github.com/DHawkesford/the-wall))

üëØ I recently published an NPM package with [@AureaFlamma](https://github.com/AureaFlamma) that helps developers to easily shorten any URLs that they want to display to users in their apps ([Site](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linkclipper) | [Repo](https://github.com/DHawkesford/LinkClipper))

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning more about Angular and Test-Driven Development by following along with *[Mastering React Test-Driven Development](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-React-Test-Driven-Development-Second-Edition)* by Daniel Irvine ([@dirv](https://github.com/dirv)), and applying what I learn to a Pok√©dex project that I am building in Angular ([Site](https://dangular-pokedex.netlify.app/) | [Repo](https://github.com/DHawkesford/angular-pokedex)) 

‚ö° When I'm not coding, you can find me running around the parks of London and rooting through its bookshops. Add me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/691392)üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è / [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/dhawkesford)üìö
