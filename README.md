I'm a student software developer from London, and in August 2022 I graduated with Cohort 12 at [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/), a free, 16-week, full-time bootcamp teaching full stack software development! 

When I'm not coding, you can find me running around the parks of London and rooting around its many bookshops. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìö
