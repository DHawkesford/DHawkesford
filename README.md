I'm a student software developer from London, studying with Cohort 12 at [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/), a free coding bootcamp! 

When I'm not coding, you can find me running around the parks of London and rooting around its many bookshops. 🏃‍♂️📚

😄 Pronouns: he/him

🌱 I'm currently learning software development with the School of Code!

🔭 I’m currently working on a photography ranking website, aimed at encouraging people to keep active 

⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid runner and currently training for a half-marathon in... the future at some point!
